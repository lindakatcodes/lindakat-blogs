# My personal tech blog!

Created using Gridsome and NetlifyCMS, and hosted on Netlify. I figured my blog would be as good as space as any to get some practice learning some new things, and since I've been interested in Vue and trying any sort of new databases and/or CMS platforms....this project gives me all of those things new!

This will stay very basic style-wise until I actually learn more about how everything works. I've managed to work out some basic styling and data gathering so far, and have some ideas for how to continue learning and improving!

Things on the plan to add:
* Tags page, where you can see all the tags and click on them to view posts with those tags
* Add a favicon that fits the site
