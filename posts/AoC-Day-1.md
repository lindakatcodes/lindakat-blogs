Advent of Code is finally here, and I'm so excited!! This is such a fun code challenge, and I was really bummed when I couldn't keep up with it last year, so I'm determined to stay on it this year and follow through until the end!

<summary>Spoilers will follow from here on out - avoid until you've solved the problems if you want!</summary>

This year is set in space! I think it'll be really fun to see how the story unfolds.
Day 1, thankfully, felt pretty good!
