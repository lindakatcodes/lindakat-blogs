I've been debating on learning a framework for a little while now, & it was recently advised to me that it would be smart to do job-wise. So I've finally decided to buckle down & learn one, & decided on Vue!

My reasoning - it's open source based; people I respect in the field rave about it & work on it; it's growing quickly; & it seemed to be a bit of a middle ground between React & Angular. Plus, I'm using a framework based on it for my personal blog! 

So I'm using this post as a basic, beginner's cheat sheet for examples of how to do things in Vue. This will be more about basic examples & what I come across, in my own words. I'm looking at how to use it, more than why it works, so I'll have it as a reference if I need it in the future.

So let's begin!
